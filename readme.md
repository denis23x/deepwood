### About üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

I decided to try making a simple game and I got hooked, it's very exciting to set up all these traps and think through the game design.

Another pet project in my collection, a brief game that takes 3‚Äì5 minutes to complete, for development download this repository and open the project in Godot.

If you like this project, feel free to give it a ‚≠ê on GitHub! It really helps me grow and stay motivated to build more awesome things. Your support means a lot!
